# 🚨 URGENT FIX: IONOS Serving Wrong Directory

## The Problem (Confirmed)

Your console shows:
```
Loading module from "/src/main.tsx" was blocked
```

**This means IONOS is serving the SOURCE files instead of the BUILT files!**

IONOS is serving from the **root directory** when it should serve from the **`dist/` directory**.

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX - Update IONOS Dashboard Settings

### Step 1: Go to IONOS Deploy Now Dashboard

1. Go to [https://www.ionos.com/hosting/deploy-now](https://www.ionos.com/hosting/deploy-now)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click on your **AssuranceHill** project

### Step 2: Update Build Settings

1. Click **"Settings"** or **"Configuration"** (gear icon)
2. Look for **"Build Configuration"** or **"Build Settings"**
3. **Update these settings:**

   ```
   Build Command: npm run build
   Publish Directory: dist
   ```
   
   ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Make sure **"Publish Directory"** or **"Output Directory"** is set to **`dist`**
   
   NOT:
   - ❌ `.` (current directory)
   - ❌ `/` (root)
   - ❌ empty/blank
   
   Must be:
   - ✅ `dist`

4. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Trigger Redeploy

1. Still in dashboard, find **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click **"Redeploy"** or **"Trigger New Deployment"**
3. Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes)

### Step 4: Verify

After deployment completes:
1. Visit your site: `https://home-5018805862.app-ionos.space`
2. **Should now show the full website!**

## Alternative: Check GitHub Actions Workflow

If IONOS auto-created a GitHub Actions workflow:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Look in `.github/workflows/` folder
3. Find the IONOS Deploy Now workflow (usually named `deploy-to-ionos.yaml` or similar)
4. Check the **`dist-folder`** setting:

```yaml
- name: Deploy to IONOS
  uses: ionos-deploy-now/deploy-to-ionos-action@v2
  with:
    dist-folder: dist    # ← Make sure this says "dist"
    runtime: static
```

5. If it's wrong, edit and commit:
```bash
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "Fix IONOS dist-folder setting"
git push
```

---

## Why This Happened

**Root cause:** IONOS deployment was configured to serve files from the project root (`/`) instead of the build output directory (`/dist/`).

**What's happening:**
- ❌ IONOS serves: `index.html` (source file) → tries to load `/src/main.tsx`
- ✅ IONOS should serve: `dist/index.html` (built file) → loads `/assets/index-[hash].js`

**The source `index.html` contains:**
```html
<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>  <!-- Development version -->
```

**The built `dist/index.html` contains:**
```html
<script type="module" src="/assets/index-BmdUCYx1.js"></script>  <!-- Production version -->
```

## Verify Settings Are Correct

After updating, check deployment logs. You should see:

```
✓ Build completed
✓ Deploying from: dist/
✓ Files deployed:
  - index.html
  - .htaccess
  - assets/index-BmdUCYx1.js
  - assets/index-Dsuk9LRb.css
  - logo.png
  - logo copy.png
```

**NOT:**
```
✗ Deploying from: /
✗ Files deployed:
  - index.html (wrong one!)
  - src/
  - public/
  - package.json
```

## If Still Not Working

### Nuclear Option: Delete & Reconnect

1. **In IONOS Dashboard:**
   - Delete the current deployment
   - Remove the project

2. **Reconnect from Scratch:**
   - Go to IONOS Deploy Now
   - Click "New Project"
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - **When asked for settings, specify:**
     - Framework: **React (Vite)**
     - Build Command: **`npm run build`**
     - Publish Directory: **`dist`** ← Most important!
   - Deploy

3. This forces IONOS to auto-detect and set correct paths

## Contact IONOS Support

If manual update doesn't work, contact support:

**Email:** deploynow-support@ionos.com

**Message:**
```
Subject: Wrong directory being served - React SPA blank page

Hello,

My React project shows a blank page because IONOS is serving from the root directory instead of the dist/ folder.

Project: AssuranceHill
URL: https://home-5018805862.app-ionos.space

Console Error:
"Loading module from '/src/main.tsx' was blocked"

This shows the source index.html is being served instead of dist/index.html.

My build settings should be:
- Build Command: npm run build
- Publish Directory: dist

Please verify the publish/output directory is set to "dist" in my project configuration.

Thanks!
```

## Summary

**The Fix:** Change IONOS **"Publish Directory"** from root to **`dist`**

**Where:** IONOS Dashboard → Your Project → Settings/Configuration

**Then:** Redeploy

**Result:** Website will load correctly! 🎉

This is a configuration issue, not a code issue. The files are correct, IONOS just needs to serve from the right folder!
