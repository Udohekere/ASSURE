# IONOS Blank Page - Troubleshooting & Fix

## Issue
Your IONOS deployment shows a blank white page instead of the AssuranceHill website.

## What I've Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Simplified .htaccess File
Created a more compatible `.htaccess` format specifically for IONOS Deploy Now:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/\.well-known/
RewriteRule . /index.html [L,QSA]
```

This removes potentially problematic directives and uses the most compatible rewrite format.

### 2. ‚úÖ Added Test Page
Created `/test.html` to help diagnose the issue.

## Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Check What's Actually Wrong

Visit your diagnostic page first:
```
https://home-5018805862.app-ionos.space/test.html
```

**If test.html loads:**
- ‚úÖ IONOS deployment is working
- ‚úÖ Files are being served
- ‚ùå There's an issue with the main app

**If test.html doesn't load:**
- ‚ùå Deployment issue
- Need to redeploy

### Step 2: Check Browser Console on Your Main Site

1. Go to: `https://home-5018805862.app-ionos.space`
2. Press **F12** (or right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Look for errors

#### Common Errors & Solutions:

**Error: "Failed to load module script"**
- **Cause**: MIME type issue
- **Fix**: .htaccess missing AddType directives
- **Solution**: Redeploy with the updated .htaccess

**Error: "404 Not Found" on /assets/ files**
- **Cause**: .htaccess rewrite rules not working
- **Fix**: Apache mod_rewrite might not be enabled
- **Solution**: Contact IONOS support or check deployment settings

**Error: "Uncaught SyntaxError"**
- **Cause**: JavaScript file corrupted or not loading as JS
- **Fix**: MIME type issue
- **Solution**: Redeploy with updated .htaccess

**No errors, just blank page:**
- **Cause**: React not mounting
- **Fix**: Check if `<div id="root"></div>` exists
- **Solution**: See below

### Step 3: Check Network Tab

1. In Developer Tools, go to **Network** tab
2. Reload the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
3. Check if these files load successfully (200 status):
   - `index.html` ‚úì
   - `/assets/index-[hash].js` ‚úì
   - `/assets/index-[hash].css` ‚úì

**If any show 404:**
- The .htaccess file isn't working properly
- Apache mod_rewrite might be disabled

**If all show 200:**
- Files are loading correctly
- Issue is in the JavaScript code

## Quick Fix: Redeploy

Since I've updated the .htaccess file, you need to redeploy:

### Option A: Via GitHub (Recommended)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix IONOS blank page with simplified .htaccess"
git push origin main
```
IONOS will automatically redeploy.

### Option B: Via IONOS Dashboard
1. Go to IONOS Deploy Now dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Click **"Redeploy"** or **"Trigger Deployment"**

---

## Alternative: Check IONOS Build Logs

1. Go to IONOS Deploy Now dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. View **"Deployments"** or **"Build Logs"**
4. Check for any errors during build

**Common build issues:**
- ‚ùå Build failed - Check package.json dependencies
- ‚ùå Dist folder empty - Build command incorrect
- ‚ùå .htaccess missing - File wasn't copied

---

## If Still Blank After Redeploy

### Try This Minimal .htaccess

If the current one doesn't work, try this even simpler version:

1. Update `public/.htaccess`:
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]
```

2. Rebuild and redeploy:
```bash
npm run build
git add dist/
git commit -m "Minimal .htaccess for IONOS"
git push
```

---

## Nuclear Option: .htaccess Template

IONOS supports `.htaccess` templates. Try this:

1. Create `.deploy-now/assurancehill/.htaccess.template`:
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

2. Commit and push
3. IONOS will copy this to your deployment root

---

## Verify Files After Deployment

SSH or check via IONOS file manager that these exist:
- ‚úì `/index.html`
- ‚úì `/.htaccess`
- ‚úì `/assets/index-[hash].js`
- ‚úì `/assets/index-[hash].css`

---

## Contact IONOS Support

If nothing works, contact IONOS with this info:

**Subject:** SPA not working - blank page on Deploy Now

**Message:**
```
Hello,

My React SPA shows a blank page after deployment to IONOS Deploy Now.

Project: AssuranceHill
URL: https://home-5018805862.app-ionos.space
Issue: Blank white page (no content)

I've checked:
- ‚úì Build successful (dist folder contains files)
- ‚úì .htaccess file present with rewrite rules
- ‚úì All files deployed correctly

Question: Is mod_rewrite enabled? Are there restrictions on .htaccess directives?

My .htaccess:
[paste the simplified .htaccess content]

Please advise.
```

**Support:** deploynow-support@ionos.com

## What to Report Back

After checking the console/network tab, tell me:

1. **Does test.html load?** (yes/no)
2. **Console errors?** (copy any red errors)
3. **Network status?** (do JS/CSS files load? 200 or 404?)
4. **Build logs?** (any errors in IONOS dashboard?)

This will help me identify the exact issue!

## Summary

1. ‚úÖ Updated .htaccess for IONOS compatibility  
2. ‚úÖ Added test.html diagnostic page  
3. üîÑ **You need to redeploy** (git push or manual redeploy)  
4. üîç **Check browser console** for specific errors  
5. üìä **Check network tab** for 404s  

The blank page is likely due to:
- .htaccess not working (mod_rewrite disabled) **OR**
- MIME type issues (JS not recognized) **OR**  
- Build output issue (files missing)

Let's diagnose which one!
