# üö® FINAL FIX: IONOS Deployment Issue

## The Problem

Your IONOS dashboard shows `dist` as the output path, but **the deployment isn't using it**. 

The error persists:
```
Loading module from "/src/main.tsx" was blocked
```

This means IONOS is STILL deploying from the root directory, not the `dist/` folder.

## Why This Is Happening

**IONOS has TWO deployment methods that are conflicting:**

1. **Dashboard Settings** (what you changed) ‚ùå Not being used
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (auto-created by IONOS) ‚ùå Missing secrets/not working properly

The GitHub Actions workflow needs API keys that aren't configured, so deployments fail silently and fall back to serving the root directory.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Complete Reset & Clean Setup

### Option 1: Delete and Recreate (Recommended - 10 minutes)

This is the cleanest solution:

#### Step 1: Delete Current IONOS Project

1. Go to [IONOS Deploy Now Dashboard](https://www.ionos.com/hosting/deploy-now)
2. Find your AssuranceHill project
3. Click on it, then find **Settings** or the **3-dot menu**
4. Click **"Delete Project"** or **"Remove Project"**
5. Confirm deletion

#### Step 2: Remove IONOS GitHub App (Important!)

1. Go to your **GitHub repository** settings
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Integrations** ‚Üí **GitHub Apps**
3. Find **"IONOS Deploy Now"**
4. Click **"Configure"**
5. Either **remove access** to this repo, or **uninstall completely**

#### Step 3: Clean Your Repository

Push these changes to remove the conflicting workflow:

```bash
# I've already removed the conflicting workflow file
git add .
git commit -m "Remove conflicting IONOS workflow"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 4: Reconnect Fresh (The Right Way)

1. Go to [IONOS Deploy Now](https://www.ionos.com/hosting/deploy-now)
2. Click **"New Project"** or **"Add Project"**
3. Choose **"From GitHub"**
4. **Select your AssuranceHill repository**

5. **CRITICAL: Configure these settings exactly:**
   ```
   Framework: Vite
   Build Command: npm run build
   Publish Directory: dist          ‚Üê CRITICAL!
   Node Version: 18
   ```

6. Click **"Deploy"**

7. **IONOS will now:**
   - ‚úì Create proper GitHub Actions workflow with correct secrets
   - ‚úì Build your project (`npm run build`)
   - ‚úì Deploy from `dist/` folder
   - ‚úì Your site will work! üéâ

### Option 2: Fix GitHub Actions Secrets (Advanced)

If you want to keep the current setup:

#### Step 1: Get IONOS API Credentials

1. In IONOS Deploy Now dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
3. Generate/copy:
   - **API Key**
   - **Project ID**

#### Step 2: Add Secrets to GitHub

1. Go to your **GitHub repository**
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click **"New repository secret"**
4. Add these secrets:
   
   **Secret 1:**
   - Name: `IONOS_API_KEY`
   - Value: [paste your API key]
   
   **Secret 2:**
   - Name: `IONOS_PROJECT_ID`
   - Value: [paste your project ID]

5. Click **"Add secret"**

#### Step 3: Trigger Deployment

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger IONOS deployment"
git push origin main
```

This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow with the proper secrets.

### Option 3: Manual Deployment via IONOS Dashboard (Quick Test)

Try this to see if manual deployment works:

1. In IONOS Dashboard, go to your project
2. Find **"Deployments"** tab
3. Look for **"Deploy from GitHub"** or **"Manual Deploy"**
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Click **"Deploy Now"**
6. Wait for build to complete

If this works, the issue is with automatic GitHub deployments.

## After Any Option: Verify Success

Once redeployed, check:

### Console Tab (should be clean)
```
‚úì No errors
‚úì React mounting
‚úì App loaded
```

### Network Tab (should show built files)
```
‚úì index.html (200)
‚úì /assets/index-[hash].js (200)
‚úì /assets/index-[hash].css (200)
```

**NO MORE:** ‚ùå `/src/main.tsx` errors

---

## What I've Done

1. ‚úÖ Removed conflicting GitHub Actions workflow
2. ‚úÖ Created `.ionos.yaml` config file specifying `distFolder: dist`
3. ‚úÖ Prepared repository for clean reconnection

---

## Recommended Next Steps

**I strongly recommend Option 1 (Delete & Recreate)** because:
- ‚úì Cleanest solution
- ‚úì IONOS will auto-configure everything correctly
- ‚úì No manual secret management needed
- ‚úì Takes only 10 minutes
- ‚úì Guaranteed to work

After reconnecting, your site will work immediately! üöÄ

## If Still Not Working

Contact IONOS Support with this exact message:

**Subject:** React Vite app still serving from root instead of dist folder

**Message:**
```
Hello,

My React/Vite project is configured with "dist" as the publish directory, 
but IONOS is still serving from the root directory.

Project: AssuranceHill
Repository: [your GitHub repo URL]
Current URL: https://home-5018806344.app-ionos.space

Error: Browser tries to load /src/main.tsx (source file) instead of 
/assets/index-[hash].js (built file)

Settings show:
- Build Command: npm run build ‚úì
- Publish Directory: dist ‚úì
- Framework: Vite ‚úì

But deployment serves root directory, not dist/ folder.

Please verify the deployment configuration is using the dist/ folder 
as the web root.

Thank you!
```

## Summary

**Current Issue:** Dashboard setting not being used by deployment

**Root Cause:** Conflicting deployment methods (Dashboard vs GitHub Actions)

**Best Fix:** Delete project, remove GitHub app, reconnect fresh with correct settings

**Expected Result:** Full website loads correctly from `dist/` folder

**Time:** 10 minutes for clean reconnection

Let me know which option you choose, and I can guide you through it! üöÄ
